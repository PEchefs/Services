Windows serial code editing guidelines:
1. Copy the entire folder watermgmt to private folder. Ex: "C:\Users\Omar Ibrahim Hussain\Documents\PHOTOELECTRICCHEFS\watermgmt\bin\Debug\watermgmt.exe"
2. Edit the files and build in Code Blocks.
3. While executing the executable, change directory to the 'bin' folder, else the program does not write log to the files.
